When building a **video streaming system for a doctor consultation website**‚Äîespecially one handling **encrypted patient records**‚Äîyou need to focus on **secure, real-time communication**, **privacy compliance (like HIPAA or GDPR)**, and **scalability**. There are several streaming APIs and platforms that can help you implement secure video consultation features.

---

### üîê Core Requirements:

1. **Secure video calling (end-to-end encrypted if possible)**
2. **HIPAA/GDPR compliance**
3. **Encrypted patient data storage and retrieval**
4. **Audit logging and access control**
5. **Integration with EHR systems**

### üß© Recommended Video Streaming APIs

| API/Service                  | Key Features                                              | Compliance                          | Notes                                  |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Twilio Video**             | Real-time video, screen sharing, encrypted media          | HIPAA-ready (with BAA)              | Popular in telehealth; excellent docs  |
| **Vonage (formerly TokBox)** | Real-time WebRTC-based video, text chat, screen sharing   | HIPAA-ready (with BAA)              | Well-supported SDKs for web and mobile |
| **Daily.co**                 | WebRTC-based video, end-to-end encryption (E2EE) optional | HIPAA-ready (on request)            | Lightweight, good for custom UIs       |
| **Agora**                    | High-quality low-latency video                            | HIPAA available (contact sales)     | Great for global teleconsultations     |
| **Zoom Video SDK**           | Integrate Zoom-quality video into your own app            | HIPAA (Zoom for Healthcare)         | Well-trusted; full BAA required        |
| **WebRTC (self-hosted)**     | Open standard for peer-to-peer video                      | Requires custom security/compliance | High control, more complexity          |

### üîê Encrypted Patient Record Handling

You‚Äôll typically want to:

* **Encrypt all patient records** using **AES-256 or similar** encryption at rest.
* **Use HTTPS/TLS** for data in transit.
* **Store encryption keys separately** using services like **AWS KMS**, **Azure Key Vault**, or **HashiCorp Vault**.
* **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to restrict who can access what.
* **Use OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect** for secure authentication (e.g., doctor vs. patient login).

---

### üì¶ Backend Tech Stack (Example)

* **Frontend**: React + Twilio Video SDK
* **Backend**: Node.js or Python Flask API (for handling logic and auth)
* **Database**: PostgreSQL (with field-level encryption), or MongoDB with client-side encryption
* **Cloud**: AWS (with HIPAA-eligible services like S3, RDS, Lambda)
* **Security**: OAuth 2.0 (Auth0 or Keycloak), encrypted API endpoints
